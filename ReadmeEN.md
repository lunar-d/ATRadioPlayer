## Getting started
To use the player with your Webradio, you start by creating a repository using the template on GitHub.
### Create a repository from the template
You can click on the following link to generate a repository using the template: [Create a repository](not set up "Create a repository")
> For more details on how to create repositories using templates, read the article on the GitHub website: [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template "Creating a repository from a template").

### Update the player configuration
The `js\settings.js` file is used as the main configuration file. In this file, you can configure the information about your webradio.

You can start by adding your radio info:
javascript
	radio_name': 'AntithÃ¨se Radio', // Name of the Radio.
	'url_streaming': 'https://www.radioking.com/play/antithesecvl', // URL of the stream, eg: https://www.radioking.com/play/IDRADIO
	'radio_id': 'antithesecvl', //ID of the radio.
	'default_cover_art': 'img/defaultArt.webp', // Default path to the coverage.
```
> What I call `IDRADIO` is simply the name in the url of your radio page on RadioKing
( https://fr.radioking.com/radio/ `id de la radio`) found at https://fr.radioking.com/ecouter-radio

Then, your page can be hosted on https://user.github.io/repo/ thanks to GitHub Page, where `user` is your GitHub username and `repo` is the name of your repository.
> For more details on GitHub Pages, read the article on the GitHub website: [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages "GitHub Pages Documentation").

### Update PWA configuration
The web application manifest `manifest.json` contains by default some settings (icons/orientation/display/start_url). You are free to change them with your information.
